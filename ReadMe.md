# Data Summary

**Observations:**  
Ensemble methods (RF, XGB, GB) significantly outperform the simple Linear Regression model.
Boosting methods (XGB and GB) show superior performance compared to bagging (RF).
The difference in performance between XGB and GB is relatively small, indicating both are strong candidates for this prediction task.


**Implications:**  
The implications of these observations suggest that more complex models like XGBoost and Gradient Boosting should be preferred for tasks requiring high prediction accuracy, given their superior performance. While Linear Regression might be too simplistic for this problem, XGBoost stands out as the most accurate model. Further tuning of the ensemble models, particularly XGBoost, could lead to even better results. These findings indicate that choosing the right model is crucial for accurate predictions, with XGBoost being the top choice in this scenario.  

**Application to Business or Research:**  
For business or research applications, choosing a model with a lower RMSE (like XGBoost) could lead to more accurate predictions, which can translate into better decision-making and more reliable outcomes.
